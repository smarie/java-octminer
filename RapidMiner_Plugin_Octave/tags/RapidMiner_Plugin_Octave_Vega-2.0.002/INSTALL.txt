RAPID MINER OCTAVE EXTENSION INSTALLATION NOTES
-----------------------------------------------

Preferred installation should be from Rapidminer update mechanisms and marketplace.

For manual installation from the sources, you also need to checkout Rapidminer sources.
Perform the following steps:

0. Checkout Rapidminer and the octave extension independently in your current folder

	svn co https://svn.java.net/svn/octminer~svnrepository/RapidMiner_Vega/trunk RapidMiner_Vega
	svn co https://svn.java.net/svn/octminer~svnrepository/RapidMiner_Plugin_Octave_Vega/trunk RapidMiner_Plugin_Octave_Vega

	You should now have two folders: 
			RapiMiner_Vega/ 
			and 
			RapidMiner_Plugin_Octave_Vega/

1. You can compile the sources using 'ant build' or 'ant dist'. Ant is a 
   java build tool (like 'make') and can be downloaded from 
   http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/. RapidMiner requires Ant version 1.6 or 
   higher. 



2. Simply copy the <plugin_name>.jar file to the directory lib/plugins of your RapidMiner
