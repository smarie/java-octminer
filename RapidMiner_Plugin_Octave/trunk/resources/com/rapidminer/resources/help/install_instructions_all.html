<h1>1. Installation Guide (all platforms)</h1>
<p>
	For using the Octave Extension of RapidMiner, you need to have Octave
	installed on your computer (http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/). You
	will need Octave version 3.6.1.<br />
</p>
<ol>
	<li>After you have installed a proper version of Octave (3.6.1 is
		supported currently), you may want to add it to the PATH environment
		variable of your OS - in such case you don't need to configure
		anything else, simply restart Rapidminer when Octave is in the PATH.</li>
	<li>If for some reason you don't want to add it to the PATH, you
		will need to specify the Octave executable explicitely using the <tt>Select
			Octave Engine</tt> button below. The path to Octave executable is
		typically <tt>C:\Octave\Octave3.6.1_gcc4.6.2\bin\octave.exe</tt>(windows)
		or octave (linux).
	</li>
	<li>Once you have changed your PATH variable or selected the
		Octave executable file manually, exit and restart Rapidminer manually.</li>
</ol>


<h1>2. Using Octave operators</h1>
<p>The Execute Octave Script operator allows to execute various
	Octave scripts as well as consuming and delivering ExampleSets. Please
	refer to the operator documentation for more details.</p>


<h1>3. Acknowledgements</h1>
<p>The extension is based upon JavaOctave at project Kenai, which is
	developed and maintained by Kim Hansen and 6 other members. Thanks to
	their work Java developers are able to access Octave without writing
	native code.</p>
