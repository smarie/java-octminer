from 2.2.3 to 2.2.4
----------------------------------------------
 * [FIX] Compatibility with RM 6.2
 
from 2.2.2 to 2.2.3
----------------------------------------------
 * [NEW] now when there is a communication timeout with the octave process, the task is tried once more on the new octave engine before giving up.
 
from 2.2.1 to 2.2.2
----------------------------------------------
 * [FIX] pool size increase is now taken into account immediately if the pool is started
 * [FIX] pool size decrease now works correctly: the engine shuts down
 
from 2.1.6 to 2.2.1
----------------------------------------------
 * [FIX] fixed a concurrency bug : when too many tasks were running in parallel, the same engine was being affected to two different operators. If these operators were using the same variable names for inputs or outputs, they were corrupting each other's variables.
 * [NEW] added two properties to setup timeouts for octave operations. Therefore octave scripts can not lock the server anymore.

from 2.1.5 to 2.1.6
----------------------------------------------
 * [FIX] now catching OctaveNonrecoverableException, replacing the corresponding engine with a new one, and automatically retrying execution once.

----------------------------------------------
* Fixed datetime conservion bug from octave to rapidminer (if the role is set to datetime in the struct/cell)

from 2.1.2 to 2.1.3
----------------------------------------------
* Fixed logging issue: Octave now logs to rapidminer.

from 2.1.1 to 2.1.2
----------------------------------------------
* fixed metadata generation : now dynamically constructing metadata from octave output (only for example sets for now)
* Added a wizard to help finding octave at startup.
* Fixed infinite join() bug when shutting down an octave engine (bug in javaoctave, new hacked version)

from 2.0.004 to 2.1.1
----------------------------------------------
