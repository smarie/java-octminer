On my installation I was missing two packages:
- javax.xml.soap >> installing axis plugin in eclipse solves this problem
- javax.wsdl 1.6 >> http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/requirements/orbit/R20100519200754/plugins/

To configure the repository use server: https://java.net/jira
(as mentioned in http://kenai.com/jira/browse/KENAI-2684)

Also you need to uncheck "save password" otherwise you will get authentication problems
(https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/IDEPLUGIN/Configuring+your+JIRA+Options+in+Eclipse)

Finally once you've added the jira repository, remember to create a new query on it to declare what tasks youre interested in.
